# Feedback Prize Efffectiveness Competition

## EDA

$$
f{'}(x*\theta(x)) - f{'}(0) = f{''}*0.5*x*\theta(x)
$$

$$
e^{t^2}
$$



## THINKING

some methods maybe useful for the task.

- warm up
- test different seed 
- loss function: label unbalanced.

## METHOD

Methods that others validate useful:

from https://www.kaggle.com/code/lastofus111/fb-infer : 

- WeightedLayerPooling
- GroupFold
- Different learning rates across layers
- Preprocessing (encoding-resolve+normalize)
